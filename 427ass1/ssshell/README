Implemented commands:
history	- acts just like history in bash, prints the command along with the command
pwd
set 	- acts like env (does not take args)
env
exit

Not implemented commands:
echo		- would be simple to implement once the parsing function is finished
cd
unset		- would be simple to implement once the parsing function is finished
pushd
popd
external	- would be simple to implement once the parsing function is finished
redirection
piping

NOTES:
Started fairly late, so obviously many features are missing.
